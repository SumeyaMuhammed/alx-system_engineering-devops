## 0x06-regular_expressions

This repository contains solutions and examples related to regular expressions. Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings.

### Contents

1. **Introduction to Regular Expressions**: 
   - Explanation of what regular expressions are and their importance in string manipulation and pattern matching.

2. **Syntax and Basics**:
   - Examples of basic regular expression syntax and commonly used symbols.
   - Explanation of metacharacters such as `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, etc.

3. **Matching Patterns**:
   - Demonstrations of how to use regular expressions to match specific patterns within strings.
   - Examples covering simple patterns like matching specific characters or sequences of characters.

4. **Modifiers and Flags**:
   - Explanation of modifiers and flags used with regular expressions, such as case sensitivity modifiers (`i`), global search flags (`g`), etc.

5. **Character Classes**:
   - Introduction to character classes and how they can be used to match specific sets or ranges of characters.

6. **Anchors and Boundaries**:
   - Explanation of anchors and boundaries in regular expressions, such as `^`, `$`, `\b`, `\B`, etc., and their significance in pattern matching.

7. **Quantifiers**:
   - Examples illustrating the usage of quantifiers like `{}`, `*`, `+`, `?`, etc., to specify the number of occurrences of a pattern.

8. **Grouping and Capturing**:
   - Explanation of grouping and capturing mechanisms in regular expressions and how they can be used to extract specific parts of a matched string.
